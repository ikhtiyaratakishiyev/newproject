              <h1>To find the top car insurance companies:</h1>
              <p>1. Visit your state insurance commissioner’s website to find complaints and other information about companies in your area.</p>
              <p>2. Ask your agent or a customer service representative any questions you have to make sure you’re getting all the coverage you need — and nothing you don’t want.</p>
              <p>3. Consider smaller insurance companies, too. Small companies offer rates well below large competitors in many locations.</p>
              <p>4. If you’ve had tickets, DUIs or other violations, be sure to shop three and five years after the incident, when surcharges can drop significantly.</p>
